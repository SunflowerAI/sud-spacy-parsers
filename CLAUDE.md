# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

Two coupled pieces of work over **Surface-Syntactic Universal Dependencies (SUD)** treebanks
(English, Chinese, Korean, Indonesian):

1. **Small CPU spaCy dependency parsers** (tagger + parser sharing one efficiency `tok2vec`)
   trained from SUD CoNLL-U.
2. A **`udep` disambiguation pipeline**: SUD labels prepositional/adpositional dependents of
   verbs with the noncommittal `udep`; we relabel each as `comp:obl` (complement) or `mod`
   (modifier) using **qwen3:8b via Ollama** (no thinking, temperature 0), then retrain and
   compare. This is the core research contribution — see `README.md` and the per-language
   results in `metrics_*.json`.

There is no package/test suite; "running it" means executing the spaCy CLI and the
`scripts/*.py` pipeline. Always use the project venv: `.venv/bin/python`.

## Environment (critical, non-obvious)

- **Python 3.12 only.** The machine default `python3` is 3.14, which has no spaCy wheels.
  `pip install spacy` does **not** pull in `click` (spaCy imports it directly) — it is pinned
  in `requirements.txt`. See `.venv/`.
- **Korean tokenizer** needs mecab-ko: the Korean spaCy pipeline (and any `config_ko.cfg`
  `init`/`train`) requires `export MECAB_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/libmecab.dylib`. mecab-ko was
  installed via Homebrew (conflicts with and unlinked the Japanese `mecab`); `mecabrc` dicdir
  points at `mecab-ko-dic`.
- **Chinese tokenizer** now uses a pkuseg model trained on GSDSimp (`segmenter = "pkuseg"`
  in `config_zh.cfg`, `[initialize.tokenizer] pkuseg_model = "models/zh_gsdsimp_pkuseg"` + GSD
  user dict), which reproduces GSD word boundaries far better than jieba (word-F1 ~0.88 vs 0.80).
  Install with `pip install spacy-pkuseg`. See "Tokeniser–treebank matching" below.
- **Ollama** must be running with `qwen3:8b` pulled. A single request already saturates the
  Metal GPU — parallel requests / `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL>1` give **no** speedup (~3 calls/s is
  the ceiling). Don't bother parallelizing.

## Common commands

```bash
PY=.venv/bin/python
export MECAB_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/libmecab.dylib   # needed whenever Korean is involved

# Convert CoNLL-U -> .spacy
$PY -m spacy convert <file>.conllu <out_dir>/ --converter conllu -n 10

# Train (English uses configs/config.cfg; per-lang use configs/config_<lang>.cfg)
$PY -m spacy train configs/config_zh.cfg --output training_zh/ \
  --paths.train corpus_zh/<prefix>-train.spacy --paths.dev corpus_zh/<prefix>-dev.spacy

# Evaluate — for zh/ko/id you MUST pass --gold-preproc (see below)
$PY -m spacy evaluate training_zh/model-best corpus_zh/<prefix>-test.spacy --gold-preproc

# Whole-pipeline drivers
bash scripts/train_baselines.sh       # convert+train+eval baselines for zh/ko/id
bash scripts/relabel_retrain.sh       # relabel udep -> retrain -> eval, all three langs

# Tokeniser-matching drivers (see "Tokeniser–treebank matching")
bash scripts/train_all_retok.sh       # prep (retokenise ko / coarsen id) + train zh/id/ko on matched tokenisation
bash scripts/eval_retok.sh            # eval each matched model: gold-preproc vs raw end-to-end (raw tok = tokeniser match)
bash scripts/relabel_retrain_retok.sh # relabel + transfer through transforms + retrain + eval, matched tokenisation
```

`spacy train` writes scores to `train_*.log`; `spacy evaluate --output` writes `metrics_*.json`.

### gold_preproc (non-obvious, essential for zh/ko/id)

`spacy evaluate` re-tokenizes raw text with the model's tokenizer; jieba/mecab segmentation
does **not** match the treebank's gold tokens, which collapses alignment (Korean LAS dropped
to ~30 before this fix). The configs set `gold_preproc = true` for the train/dev corpora and
**evaluation must use `--gold-preproc`**, so everything runs on gold tokens. English (spacing
matches) doesn't need it.

When editing configs programmatically, load with `Config().from_disk(p, interpolate=False)` —
the default interpolation resolves `${paths.train}` to null and silently breaks CLI path
overrides (this caused `E913` errors).

### Sentence segmentation (learned; `gold_tok_corpus.py`, `config_*_seg.cfg`, `retrain_seg.sh`)

`gold_preproc = true` had a hidden cost: it feeds the parser one **pre-segmented** sentence at a
time, so the parser never learned to *start* a sentence — on raw multi-sentence input the released
non-English models collapsed everything into one tree (raw `SENT F` 0). `en` was fine (trained
`gold_preproc=false`); `lzh`/`sa` segment via `clause_parser` (their treebanks carry no in-text
boundaries, so they can't learn them). The released models now **learn** boundaries via a custom
reader: **`scripts/gold_tok_corpus.py`** registers `sud.GoldTokCorpus.v1`, which yields whole
multi-sentence docs (corpora are `convert -n 10`) but with **gold tokenisation** for the predicted
doc — so segmentation is learned with **zero tokeniser skew** (matters for zh/yue pkuseg). Toolchain:
`make_seg_config.py` derives `config_<lang>_seg.cfg` (swaps both corpus readers + sets `sents_f`
weight 0.05); `seg_code.py` is the single `--code` loader (spacy **train** `--code` takes one file,
unlike **package**); `retrain_seg.sh <langs>` retrains each released arm into `training_<lang>_seg/`;
`regen_idko_corpora.sh` rebuilds the cleaned-up id/ko corpora from the surviving `*.relabeled.conllu`.
Each released arm was retrained with its own recipe (la = ext+macron union `corpus_la_ext_union/`,
zh = `config_zh_both` + baked pkuseg, yue = `zh_both_tok2vec.bin` init + `bundle_yue_pkuseg.py` swap)
and repackaged with `package_seg.sh` (sa/lzh repackaged from `model-seg`, new `clause_parser`, no
retrain). **Result (raw end-to-end LAS / `SENT F`, old→new):** ar 69.4→72.4 / 0→66, fa 79.2→85.3 /
0→99, ja 81.9→85.8 / 0→96, id 68.3→73.4 / 0→87, ko 68.6→74.3 / 0→90, la 63.9→70.9 / 0→74,
zh 54.3→57.4 / 0→99, yue 52.0→60.0 / 2→81 — raw LAS up everywhere (correct boundaries help parsing),
gold-preproc LAS within ~1 (the research metrics above are gold-preproc and still describe the
relabel contribution). Re-released over v0.1.0 (clobber); `en` unchanged.

### UPOS morphologisers (`make_morph_config.py`, `train_morph.sh`, `package_morph.sh`)

The released pipelines were `[tok2vec, tagger, parser]` — the `tagger` predicts **XPOS** (`tag_`),
so `token.pos_` (UPOS) was **empty** in output (no `morphologizer`; the parser's embed reads only
`["NORM","PREFIX","SUFFIX","SHAPE"]`, so POS never fed parsing anyway). To emit UPOS+morph for
downstream tasks **without changing parsing**, every released arm gained a `morphologizer` trained
with a **freeze recipe**: source the released `tok2vec`/`tagger`/`parser`, **freeze** them, and train
ONLY a new `morphologizer` that carries its **OWN small `HashEmbedCNN`** (width 64 / depth 3 / embed
2000). A *dedicated* encoder (not a listener) is the key choice — it is immune to treebanks whose
**XPOS is orthogonal to UPOS** (id: 33/46 XPOS values map to >1 UPOS). Verified empirically on id:
standalone-frozen 92.8 vs listener-on-frozen-encoder 92.2 (the orthogonality penalty) vs **co-train**
92.95 *but* LAS −0.3 / TAG −0.5 — so **co-training is dominated** (no UPOS gain, hurts parsing) and
was discarded. The frozen components are **byte-identical** to the release (verified per-arm with
`cmp` on `*/model`), so parse/seg metrics need no re-verification. `make_morph_config.py` derives
`config_<lang>_morph.cfg` from the released arm's (seg) config: sources+freezes the three, nulls
`init_tok2vec` (else yue's Mandarin-init `zh_both_tok2vec.bin` clobbers the sourced encoder and breaks
the parser's input), and keeps only factory args common to the standard **and** `ja.morphologizer`
factories (the latter rejects `label_smoothing`/`overwrite`/`extend`). `train_morph.sh` trains all 11
arms (en uses the plain `config.cfg`; lzh/sa source from `model-seg`); `package_morph.sh` packages
each (lzh/sa re-append `clause_parser` **after** the morphologiser — `clause_parser` reads `pos_` from
the whole-doc pass and preserves it through its re-parse; yue re-runs `bundle_yue_pkuseg.py`).
**UPOS (`pos_acc`), small encoder:** en 0.934, ar 0.946, fa 0.960, ja 0.967, id 0.928, ko 0.939,
la 0.955, zh 0.896, yue 0.911, lzh 0.912, sa 0.877 (UPOS ≥ the model's own XPOS acc where XPOS is
coarse-mappable; en UPOS 0.934 > XPOS 0.929). Wheels add ~+2 MB; re-released over v0.1.0 (clobber).

## Tokeniser–treebank matching (`retokenize.py`, `coarsen_id.py`, `train_pkuseg_zh.py`)

`gold_preproc` sidesteps the tokeniser/treebank mismatch for *evaluation*; this layer makes the
tokeniser and treebank actually **agree**, so the parsers work on raw text (raw-eval `tok` is now
0.941 zh / 0.999 id / 1.000 ko, up from a Korean collapse to ~LAS 30). Direction is chosen per
language by whether the treebank tokenisation is a deterministic function of the text:

- **zh — bend the tokeniser to the treebank.** No spaces ⇒ word segmentation is statistical,
  never lossless. `train_pkuseg_zh.py` trains a pkuseg model on GSDSimp (`spacy_pkuseg.train`;
  `train_iter` >20 doesn't help, fine-tuning from `spacy_ontonotes` barely helps; a GSD word-type
  **user dictionary** adds ~+0.04). Best word-F1 ~0.88 vs jieba 0.80. NB the ~0.94 pkuseg reports
  is the lenient *cut-point* F, not word-level F. Wired into `config_zh.cfg`.
- **ko — retokenise the treebank (finer).** `retokenize.py --lang ko` splits each eojeol into its
  mecab morphemes (matching `KoreanTokenizer` exactly) and builds eojeol-internal structure
  **functional-head** per the mSUD standard: the case particle (ADP) / verbal ending (AUX) heads,
  the lexical stem is `comp:obj`/`comp:aux`. This lands `udep`/`comp:obl`/`mod` on the case
  particle — parallel to the adpositions in the other languages. Lossless + reversible (asserts
  per-sentence round-trip). Evidence for functional-head: the native `mSUD_Nenets-Tundra` treebank
  (case suffix = ADP heads its noun via `comp:obj`; verbal suffix = AUX is the clause root).
- **id — coarsen the treebank.** Enclitics (`-nya/-lah/…`) are lexically ambiguous (`-lah` is a
  clitic 73× but inside whole words like `adalah`/`salah` 1723×) and not rule-separable, so
  `coarsen_id.py` merges each MWT range (host+enclitic) into one whitespace token, which the rule
  tokeniser reproduces deterministically. token-F1 vs spaCy 0.955→0.989.
- **en — leave as is.** `Tokenizer.v1` already matches EWT at the rule ceiling (F1 0.991);
  hyphen/slash tweaks both regress (EWT is internally inconsistent). A useful negative result.

`retokenize.py` also has a general char-span align + reproject path (merge/split/crossing +
cycle/root repair) used for zh boundary disagreements; for ko every block is a clean 1→m split.
**Reversibility invariant**: new tokens are surface substrings + carry `SpaceAfter=No`, so
concatenation reproduces the text. Only **en** and **ko-eojeol** are deterministically matchable;
**zh** and **id** stay statistical, so keep `--gold-preproc` for fair parser comparison. The
relabel decisions are tokenisation-agnostic, so `relabel_retrain_retok.sh` relabels at the
original tokenisation (cached) and **transfers** the labels through these transforms (which
preserve deprels) rather than re-relabelling the retokenised data.

## Pipeline architecture (`scripts/`)

Data flows: download SUD `.tgz` → extract to `assets*/` → merge/convert → `corpus*/*.spacy` →
train → relabel `udep` → retrain. Naming convention: English artifacts are unsuffixed
(`corpus/`, `training/`, `metrics.json`); other languages use `_<lang>` suffixes; relabeled
variants use `_rl`/`_relabeled`; improved (contrastive-prompt) reruns use `_rl2`.
Matched-tokenisation variants add `_simp` (zh pkuseg/GSDSimp), `_coarse` (id enclitic-merged),
`_retok` (ko morphemes); these compose with `_rl` (e.g. `training_ko_retok_rl/`,
`metrics_zh_simp_rl_gp.json`). For matched models, `metrics_*_{gp,raw}.json` hold the
gold-preproc and raw end-to-end evaluations.

- **`disambiguate_pp.py`** — foundation module imported everywhere. `parse_conllu`,
  `descendants` (dependency subtree), `render` (subtree → surface text, trims edge punct),
  and `query` (the canonical qwen3:8b call: `think:false`, `temperature:0`, normalized
  one-word answer). Other scripts load it via `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`.
- **`build_gold.py`** (English) / **`lang_gold.py`** (zh/ko/id) — build the *confident* comp/mod
  benchmark from `udep` cases that are unambiguous: COMPLEMENT = verb lexically selects the
  adposition (curated `(verb, adp)` frame lists); MODIFIER = temporal/causal adposition or
  temporal-object. Writes `gold_*.jsonl`. (SUD's own committed labels are too sparse/noisy,
  which is why the gold is rule-built.) Note the temporal-object override: a frame with a
  year/temporal object → modifier (e.g. "believe in 1999").
- **`eval_prompts.py`** (English) / **`lang_bench.py`** (zh/ko/id) — benchmark prompt variants
  against the gold. Prompts are **static prefix (definitions + few-shot) + short variable
  suffix (the sentence)** so Ollama reuses the cached prefix KV (~4× speedup); keep them this
  way. `eval_prompts.PREFIXES["fewshot12_def"]` is the canonical English prompt.
- **`zh_bench.py` / `id_bench.py` / `en_bench.py`** — curated same-adposition contrastive
  few-shot (e.g. 在/于 place-vs-time, di/pada selected-vs-temporal). `en_errors.py` does
  error analysis to drive these.
- **`relabel.py`** (English) / **`lang_relabel.py`** (zh/ko/id) — apply the chosen prompt to
  the full in-scope `udep` set, rewriting `udep`→`comp:obl`/`mod` in CoNLL-U. Resumable via
  on-disk `relabel_cache*.jsonl` (every model decision flushed). `lang_relabel` uses the
  confident **rule first**, model only for the genuinely ambiguous remainder; `CHOSEN` /
  `EXTRA_SHOTS` hold the winning per-language prompt. Block-based rewriter preserves the file
  byte-for-byte except target deprel cells — verify round-trip before long runs.
- **`relabel_ext.py`** (all four langs) — **extended scope** beyond ADP-of-VERB, writing separate
  `*.relabeled_ext.conllu` (baselines untouched), cache `relabel_cache_ext_<lang>.jsonl` (seeded
  from the baseline caches so verb decisions aren't re-queried). Adds: ADP dependents of
  **NOUN/PROPN/ADJ** heads; clausal verb PPs (the no-VERB-in-subtree filter is dropped for VERB
  heads only); **participial** complex prepositions (`according/based/following`→mod); a Korean
  **case-suffix rule** (`ko_case_label`: particle off the rightmost head-final eojeol → mod for
  locative/temporal/comitative, comp for dative 에게 and selecting frames, model for 로/으로/topic/
  bare); zh 的/之 associative PART→mod; ko ADV-of-VERB→mod. **Partitives (NUM/DET/PRON heads) stay
  `udep`** (SUD's documented default — `nmod`→`udep`; user decision). Reuses the baseline
  per-language prompt — `eval_prompts.suffix()` names the head word generically, so it reads
  naturally for noun/adjective heads. Retrain with **`relabel_retrain_ext.sh`** → `corpus_*_ext` /
  `training_*_ext` / `metrics_*_ext.json` (printed base vs verb-rl vs ext, LAS + comp:obl F).
- **`udep_audit.py` / `udep_probe.py` / `hard_examples.py`** — analysis behind the extended scope:
  profile every `udep` by head/dep POS (in-scope vs out); committed comp/mod base rates per head
  POS; the Korean case-particle calibration that produced `KO_MOD_CASES`/`KO_COMP_CASES`
  (`udep_probe.py --ko-case`); and a sampler for the residue left as `udep`.

## Key empirical findings (so you don't re-derive them)

- Relabeling `udep`→binary comp/mod lowers headline **LAS by ~1–2** in every language (the
  binary is harder than the noncommittal label) while **UAS is unchanged** (only labels change).
  The metric that reflects disambiguation quality is per-label **`comp:obl` F**.
- Few-shot composition only slides the precision/recall frontier; it can't beat a good prompt.
  English plateaus at ~0.91–0.93 on qwen3:8b; gains there came from **auditing the gold**, not
  more examples.
- Value scales with how genuinely ambiguous the adpositional system is: high for English /
  Indonesian (prepositional), and — *at the verb-ADP scope* — near-vacuous for Korean
  (postpositional, `udep` adpositions ~96% temporal/causal modifiers). **The extended scope
  overturns the Korean conclusion** (see below): Korean's `comp:obl` signal lives on bare
  case-marked NOUN dependents of verbs, not on the few ADP tokens.
- The relabel signal survives the tokeniser matching: on the matched tokenisation, relabeling
  moves **`comp:obl` F** by id +17 / zh +10 / ko −12 (gold-preproc) — the same ambiguity-scaling
  story, with the Korean drop being the near-vacuous case (relabeling only adds a few hard
  `comp:obl` instances that dilute the class). Headline LAS still falls ~1–2 everywhere.
- Matching the tokeniser to the treebank is usually better than re-tokenising the treebank, and
  only needed at all when you want a *different granularity* than the treebank has (the ko
  morpheme case). A trained segmenter is **not** lossless — only deterministic tokenisations
  (en rules, ko-eojeol whitespace) can be matched exactly.
- **Extended scope (`relabel_ext.py`, plain tokenisation + gold-preproc):** disambiguating
  `udep` beyond verb-headed adpositions (noun/propn/adj heads, clausal verb PPs, participials,
  Korean case-marked NOUN dependents) lifts per-label **`comp:obl` F** further than the verb-only
  relabel — base → verb-rl → **ext**: id 0.463→0.565→**0.703**, ko 0.169→0.247→**0.386**,
  zh 0.190→0.307→**0.356** — with headline **LAS flat** (±0.01). English regresses slightly
  (comp:obl F 0.740→0.730): it already had a large, well-disambiguated verb `comp:obl` set, so
  noun/adjective heads dilute the class. **Korean is *not* near-vacuous** once the case suffix on
  noun dependents is used (the verb-ADP-only view missed where its signal lives). Caveat: each
  relabel rewrites the *test* gold too, so `comp:obl` F has a moving denominator (same caveat as
  base-vs-rl). Partitives are left `udep` by design.
- **Six more languages (fa/ar/la/sa/lzh/ja; `*_new.sh` drivers, configs `config_<lang>.cfg`).**
  Treebanks: Persian-PerDT, Arabic-PADT, Latin-ITTB+PROIEL+Perseus (merged; see the Latin section
  below for the Perseus addition), Sanskrit-Vedic,
  Classical_Chinese-Kyoto, Japanese-GSD. Per-language relabel model (Phase-3 benchmark, English
  prompt unless noted): fa/sa/lzh→qwen3:8b, ar/la→gemma4, **ja→qwen3 + native-Japanese prompt**
  (`OLLAMA_MODEL` env selects it; `disambiguate_pp.MODEL` reads it). `comp:obl` F base→verb-rl→ext:
  **fa 0.705→0.815→0.794, ja 0.000→0.720→0.688, ar 0.617→0.659→0.634, la 0.678→0.691→0.684,
  lzh 0.716→0.659→0.664, sa 0.404→—→0.352** (LAS within ~1 throughout). The thesis holds across
  language types: relabelling **helps genuinely-ambiguous prepositional systems** (fa/ja/ar/la) and
  **hurts the near-vacuous/model-limited ones** (lzh: `udep` coverbs ~mostly modifiers, model 0.70;
  sa: case-based, model ~chance on the Ins/Acc residue), and ext dilutes `comp:obl` F where the
  verb set is already strong (fa/en/ja/ar/la — の/noun-heads). **Japanese GSD commits *no*
  `comp:obl`** (all particle deps left `udep`), so the relabel synthesises the class from scratch
  (F 0→0.72) — the cleanest demonstration of the LLM adding new annotation.
  - **Two `udep` families.** Prepositional (fa/ar/la/lzh/ja — the adposition/particle is the ADP
    head of the NP) use the verb-frame gold; case-based (sa) uses the dependent's morphological
    **Case** (parallel to Korean). Associative genitive → mod, like zh 的: **lzh 之** and **ja の**
    (relabel_ext buckets `lzh_zhi`/`ja_no`, deterministic).
  - **Classical Chinese coverb rule** (`LZH_LOC_COMP_VCLASS`/`lzh_coverb_label` in lang_gold;
    `lzh_coverb` bucket in relabel_ext). The bulk of lzh's coverb signal does **not** live on plain
    `udep` (which both relabel pipelines scope to) — it lives on the **subtyped** `udep@lmod`
    (locative, ~3029) and `udep@tmod` (temporal, ~105) ADP<-VERB deps, which the plain-`udep` scope
    never reached. relabel_ext now brings them in and decides them from the annotators' own semantic
    category + the head verb's class (XPOS field 3): **@tmod → mod** (WHEN adjunct); **@lmod →
    comp:obl** only under a locus-selecting verb class (移動 motion / 姿勢 posture / 設置 placement /
    存在 existence / 生物 birth-death), else **mod** (circumstantial locative). Object FEATS `Case=Tem`/
    `Case=Loc` is the same signal for any *plain*-`udep` coverb (via `classify`). This commits ~815
    of the test coverbs (`udep` 1288→473) and **nearly doubles the comp:obl class** (test 182→355,
    incl. the locative-complement construction the LLM relabel had entirely missed): comp:obl F
    base→verb-rl→**ext 0.716→0.685→0.701** (with the frame rule below), **precision 0.72**, **LAS
    flat 0.789→0.790**, mod F unchanged. So lzh is near-vacuous only on the *plain* `udep` residue;
    the locative complements
    are a real, learnable comp:obl class (same lesson as Korean's case-marked NOUN deps).
  - **lzh plain-`udep` 於 routing (object semantic class).** After Loc/Tem are ruled, the residue
    splits ~evenly person 958 / non-person 912. The treebank commits **0 comp:obl and 0 mod on
    於+person** (maximally ambiguous: recipient-dative vs comparison vs passive-agent) — only the LLM
    can adjudicate it. **於+non-person** *is* committed (84:54, ~61% comp), so a verb-frame rule fits.
    The default `_derive_comp_frames` (minc=8/thresh=.85) yields *no* lzh frames (too sparse), so
    `COMP_FRAMES["lzh"]` is derived loosely (**minc=2/thresh=.70 → ~15 frames**: 至於/達於/在於/異於/
    甚於/長於/怒於…), committing ~132 non-person comps by rule. So the LLM is scoped to where it is the
    only tool — **於+person and the non-frame non-person residue** — while frames + Loc/Tem + the
    @lmod/@tmod subtypes carry everything decidable by rule. No re-querying needed: the rule
    intercepts cases *before* the cache; person 於 has no committed gold so its LLM decisions are
    inherently unvalidatable (no benchmark possible).
  - **Sanskrit case rule** (`SA_MOD_CASES` in lang_gold; `sa_case_label` in relabel_ext): recipients
    are **dative** (confirmed in-treebank: dā/prayam+Dat), not locative — the locative-of-locus is
    the Vedic ritual `hu` "offer into fire-LOC", which SUD leaves `udep`/mod. So Loc/Abl/Voc/Nom→mod,
    recipient datives→comp via the (verb,Case) frames; **blanket Dat→comp is avoided** (the
    dative-of-purpose is adjunctival); Ins/Acc/Gen/Dat-of-purpose → model.
  - **Tokenisers.** fa/ar/la/sa = rule tokeniser + gold_preproc. **lzh has no spaCy module**:
    `scripts/lzh_tokenizer.py` registers a custom `lzh` language + char tokeniser (one Han char =
    one token, deterministic), loaded via `spacy ... --code`; the shipped wheel bundles it. ja =
    SudachiPy + gold_preproc. fa/ja run on raw text (TOK 99.1/99.4); **sa & lzh need pre-segmented
    sentences** (Vedic/Kyoto carry no in-text sentence boundaries — raw LAS collapses to ~41/~48).
    `scripts/clause_parser.py` (lzh + sa, last pipe) recovers per-sentence parses on punctuated
    editions. A **sentence** is the span between two sentence-final marks (`sent_punct`); within it
    the content tokens are concatenated **with sentence-medial marks removed** and parsed as one doc,
    then every mark is reattached as `punct`. For lzh `sent_punct` is empty, so *every* mark is
    sentence-final and each 句讀 unit is parsed in isolation (unchanged). **Sanskrit sets
    `sent_punct = "।॥|/.?!…"`** so a comma is *medial*: the comma-separated units are parsed together
    (the parser itself relates them — no fabricated `parataxis`) and the comma reattaches as a `punct`
    child of the **head of its left unit**, so only a daṇḍa/full stop ends a sentence
    (`add_clause_parser.py --sent-punct`). It also **normalises punctuation morphology** — Kyoto/Vedic carry almost no
    punctuation, so the tagger hallucinates content tags on it (？→名詞,糧食 "noun, food", 。→動詞,
    brackets even become ROOTs). Every punctuation token (Unicode P*, incl. quotation brackets) is
    forced to `pos=PUNCT` + a deterministic XPOS: the Kyoto `s,記号,{句点,読点,括弧開,括弧閉}` map for lzh,
    or the component's `punct_tag` config string flat (sa sets `punct_tag = "PUNCT"`, so the daṇḍa is
    not stamped with Japanese-tagset notation). gold-preproc eval bypasses clause_parser, so metrics
    are unaffected — this is purely a raw-inference fix. Repackage the lzh/sa wheels to ship it.
  - **Released (v0.1.0), all 6 + the original 4:** `fa_sud_perdt` (ext), `ja_sud_gsd` (ext),
    `ar_sud_padt` (ext), `la_sud_ittbproielperseus` (ext), `sa_sud_sandhi_csl` (base, **CSL-reverted** —
    accepts sandhied CSL, de-sandhies to clean wordforms; see below; re-clobbered at 0.1.0),
    `lzh_sud_kyoto` (**ext** —
    bundles `training_lzh_ext` + `clause_parser` with the punctuation-morphology fix; replaced the
    base wheel in-place at 0.1.0 via `gh release upload --clobber`). Wheels live on the GitHub
    Release, not committed (`dist/` gitignored). Rebuild a custom-code wheel with
    `spacy package <model> <out> --code scripts/lzh_tokenizer.py,scripts/clause_parser.py --build wheel`
    (add `clause_parser` to the model first; remember `pip install click` — spaCy imports it directly).
  - **Both Han scripts (`zh_sud_gsdboth`, `lzh_sud_kyoto`; `scripts/both_scripts_release.sh`).** Both
    models train on a traditional+simplified union. **zh was renamed `sud_gsdsimp`→`sud_gsdboth`** (old
    asset deleted): it trains on the two *real* treebanks for the same sentences — `SUD_Chinese-GSD`
    (original traditional) + `SUD_Chinese-GSDSimp` (simplified auto-conversion) — NOT an OpenCC
    re-traditionalisation (simplification is lossy/many-to-one). The ext relabel lives on GSDSimp;
    `transfer_relabel_gsd.py` overlays it onto aligned GSD tokens (udep-only + alignment guard;
    comp:obl/mod is script-independent). pkuseg is retrained on the union (`models/zh_gsdboth_pkuseg`),
    swapped into the bundle post-hoc (gold_preproc training is segmenter-agnostic). **lzh** has no
    simplified counterpart treebank, so its simplified half IS OpenCC `t2s` of Kyoto
    (`scripts/opencc_conllu.py`; char-level, length-preserving). gold-preproc: zh combined LAS 69.3 /
    comp:obl F 32.6 (simp 35.3, GSD-trad 29.9); lzh combined LAS 79.0 / comp:obl F 70.9 — both within
    ~0.2 LAS across scripts, LAS/disambiguation unchanged vs the single-script ext models.
  - **Cantonese (`yue_sud_hk`; `scripts/{split_yue,yue_tokenizer,train_yue,train_pkuseg_yue,bundle_yue_pkuseg}.py`).**
    Coverb/prepositional like zh/lzh: in-scope `udep` ADPs are coverbs (喺 at, 畀 dative, 到 goal, 由
    from, 根據 according-to), decided by the same verb-frame/temporal `lang_gold` rules + qwen3:8b
    (`CHOSEN["yue"]=SUD_DEF`; gold 30c/12m, model==gemma4). ext adds two deterministic buckets in
    relabel_ext: associative/genitive **嘅** (plain `udep` PART → mod, like zh 的/lzh 之/ja の) and the
    annotators' temporal subtype **`udep@tmod`** (而家/今日/嗰陣時 → mod, like lzh @tmod), plus bare
    NOUN-of-VERB (temporal-lemma→mod rule, else model) and ADP-of-NOUN/ADJ. comp:obl F base→verb-rl→
    **ext 0.308→0.261→0.348**, LAS ~flat (noisy: see below). **SUD_Cantonese-HK is test-only** (1004
    sents) → deterministic 80/10/10 round-robin split (`split_yue.py`, also copies empty XPOS←UPOS so
    the tagger predicts UPOS in `tag_`; `pos_` empty). No spaCy `yue` module → `yue_tokenizer.py`
    registers a custom `yue` language. **tok2vec is Mandarin-init by default**: `config_yue.cfg` bakes
    `init_tok2vec = zh_both_tok2vec.bin` (extracted from `training_zh_both/model-best` via
    `model.to_bytes()`; needs the `[pretraining]` component/layer block — spaCy's cross-lang `source=`
    is blocked by E150 vocab-lang). vs from-scratch: TAG +0.4–1.4, UAS +0.7/+1.2 (base/ext), baseline
    LAS +1.15; **comp:obl F within 100-sent noise**. **Raw tokeniser = pkuseg** (`yue.PkusegTokenizer.v1`,
    falls back to char tok): word-F1 0.95 vs char 0.63; **fine-tuning pkuseg from `zh_gsdboth` ties
    from-scratch (0.9474 vs 0.9472)** so the self-contained from-scratch model ships (userdict *hurt*,
    0.93). Released v0.1.0 = ext arm + pkuseg, packaged from `training_yue_ext_pkuseg` (swap via
    `bundle_yue_pkuseg.py`; meta requires `spacy-pkuseg`; no clause_parser — sentence-segmented).

## Latin (`la_sud_ittbproielperseus`): three treebanks, macrons, XPOS blanking

The released Latin model trains on a plain `cat` of three SUD Latin treebanks (each keeps its own
sent_ids): **ITTB + PROIEL + Perseus**. `scripts/add_perseus_la.sh` is the reproducible driver
(phases `merge|macron|relabel|train`); it composes the macron and ext-relabel pipelines below.

- **Perseus splits.** Perseus ships only train + test (no dev), so it is added **train→train,
  test→test**; dev stays ITTB+PROIEL. Source: `grew.fr/download/SUD_2.18/SUD_Latin-Perseus.tgz`
  (ITTB in `assets_la/SUD_Latin-ITTB`, PROIEL in `assets_la2/SUD_Latin-PROIEL`).
- **XPOS blanking (non-obvious).** The three treebanks use mutually-incompatible XPOS tagsets (field
  5): ITTB Index-Thomisticus codes, PROIEL 2-letter, Perseus 9-position morphology. ITTB+PROIEL
  already mixed two and coped (TAG ~92), but Perseus's sparse fine tagset on ~1.3k sents tags at
  ~34% and tanks the combined TAG/LAS. Fix: **blank Perseus XPOS** (`scripts/blank_perseus_xpos.py`,
  field 5→`_` on the Perseus tail of each split; folded into `add_perseus_la.sh do_merge`). UPOS,
  FORM and dependencies are kept, so Perseus still trains the parser — only the tagger stays coherent.
  Blanking is orthogonal to the macron (FORM) and relabel (DEPREL) transforms.
- **Results (gold-preproc, ext+macron union = release).** Apples-to-apples on the ITTB+PROIEL test:
  LAS 77.7→**78.3**, UAS 83.1→83.8, `comp:obl` F ~69 (Perseus *improves* the original domain).
  Perseus-only test LAS ~54.6 (classical poetry — genuinely hard). Combined-test headline LAS 73.9 /
  comp:obl F 65.2 is lower only because the test now includes Perseus. ext relabel uses
  `OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma4:latest`; macrons via the Docker macroniser (see `macronise_la.py`).
- **Macrons.** One union parser handles plain + macronised input (`scripts/train_la_ext_macron.sh`
  trains on plain-ext ∪ macron-ext; `macronise_la.py` restores macrons via the Alatius Docker
  macroniser, `transfer_macrons.py` composes the FORM transform onto the ext deprels).
- **Licence: CC BY-NC-SA (NonCommercial).** All three sources are NC (ITTB BY-NC-SA 3.0, PROIEL
  BY-NC-SA, Perseus BY-NC-SA 2.5) — the only NonCommercial released model. See `NOTICE.md`.

## Sanskrit sandhied-CSL representation (`sa_sud_sandhi_csl`)

The released Sanskrit model **replaces `sa_sud_vedic`**. It **accepts sandhied text in
Clay-Sanskrit-Library (CSL) conventions** (the Vedic treebank is natively *pausa*/unsandhied; UFAL
is classical Pañcatantra prose) but parses **CSL-reverted wordforms**: the tokeniser undoes the
notation-marked sandhi (vowel coalescence + avagraha) and the parser is trained on those reverted
forms — cleaner than the sandhied surface, so it parses better (LAS 54.3 vs 53.5). The pipeline is
(1) build the sandhied CSL representation, then (2) revert the marked sandhi for both training and
inference. Representation, built once and shared by both treebanks:

- **`scripts/external_sandhi.py`** — forward classical external-sandhi engine (`join_pair`): vowel
  coalescence (savarṇa/guṇa incl. `a+ṛ→` word2 `r`, vṛddhi, yaṇ, ayādi/avagraha), visarga (`-aḥ→
  -o/-aś/-as`, `-iḥ→-ir`, `-āḥ→-ā`, final `-s`=visarga), `m→ṃ`, `-t→-d/-c/-j`, `-n→-ṃs/ñ/nn`,
  `t+ś→cch`, stop voicing; `internal=True` suppresses external-only rules (the `-n→-nn`
  gemination) for bound junctions. NB **no gold sandhied text exists**, so this is rule-based
  *generation* validated by the round-trip + textbook unit tests, not against a reference.
- **`scripts/apply_vedic_sandhi.py`** — applies it to the Vedic treebank within each sentence
  (`assets_sa/SUD_Sanskrit-Vedic/sa_vedic-sud-{train,dev,test}.sandhi.conllu`): compounds AND
  verb-**preverbs** (upasarga whose `head==` the following VERB; excludes tmesis) hyphen-joined
  with internal sandhi; the privative **`a-/an-`** sandhi'd + hyphen-joined (no gemination);
  pragṛhya duals, elided `_`, and sentence edges left in pausa. `generate()` chains sandhi
  **sequentially left-to-right** (carrying each word's evolving surface into the next junction) —
  needed for **single-character words**, notably the emphatic particle **`u`**: computing junctions
  independently mishandled it (`atha u āhuḥ` → `ath' u āhuḥ`, the `u` left uncoalesced); sequencing
  yields the correct `ath' ô āhuḥ` (= atho), which reverts cleanly to `atha u`. (Earlier versions
  bailed on these via an overlap guard; the fix touched 92 dev/train/test tokens, 90 of them `u`,
  with train/test reverted forms unchanged so the released model is unaffected.)
- **`scripts/sa_csl_prep.py`** (UFAL) — alignment-based CSL: transliterate Devanagari→IAST,
  re-segment MWTs (compounds hyphen-joined, external sandhi space-resegmented into surface forms,
  vowel coalescence marked); hard cases hand-corrected via `sa_ufal_csl_overrides.tsv`; typographic
  double quotes → **guillemets `«»`** (CSL direct-speech mark) before normalise.
- **`scripts/sa_tokenizer.py`** — reproduces the tokenisation (hyphen-split keeping `-` on the left
  member; daṇḍa/`||` run-grouping; `circumflix` U+0302 NOT stripped as it's a coalescence mark);
  **accepts CSL compound `|`** (word-internal `|`→`-`; a sentence daṇḍa `|` is never letter-followed)
  and **straightens curly apostrophes/double-quotes → `' "`**; then **reverses the CSL-marked
  sandhi** via `desandhi_csl` (see below) before building the `Doc`.
- **`desandhi_csl` (`scripts/sa_tokenizer.py`) + `scripts/revert_csl_sandhi.py`** — the inverse of
  the coalescence marks. `desandhi_csl(tokens)` walks the ordered token list and undoes ONLY the
  notation-marked sandhi: **vowel coalescence** (the left word's `'`/`"` + the right word's
  circumflex/macron mark `â ê î ô û / ē ō / âi âu` together encode both original vowels — split them
  back) and **avagraha** (leading `'`→`a`). The unmarked **consonant/visarga** sandhi (visarga →
  -o/-r/-ā, m → ṃ, t/n assimilation) is **left on the surface** — CSL leaves it ambiguous (e.g. `-r`
  + vowel vs a genuine `-r` stem) and it cannot be reversed without a lexicon, so full pausa is not
  deterministically recoverable (the standard Sanskrit sandhi-splitting problem). Two fallbacks
  clear the residue from `apply_vedic_sandhi`'s single-char-particle overlap guard: an unpaired
  trailing `'`/`"` → restore the dominant a-stem vowel (`a`/`ā`), and a leading **circumflex** (only
  ever a coalescence mark, never genuine) → restore unconditionally. Validated: **0 residual marks**
  over 208 k tokens; 83.7 % of marked tokens reach pure pausa (== `Unsandhied=`), the rest keep
  consonant surface by design. `revert_csl_sandhi.py` applies the *same* `desandhi_csl` to the
  sandhied CoNLL-U (rewriting FORM + MWT-range surfaces, regenerating `# text`) → `*.csl_rev.conllu`,
  so training data and the runtime tokeniser produce identical forms.
- Trained on **CSL-reverted Vedic-train + UFAL** (`corpus_sa_csl_rev/`, `config_sa.cfg`, `--code
  scripts/sa_tokenizer.py`) → `training_sa_csl_rev/`, `metrics_sa_csl_rev.json` (gold-preproc on
  CSL-reverted Vedic test: **LAS 54.3 / UAS 67.7 / TAG 88.3 / comp:obl F 44.5**, ~1.5 LAS under the
  pausa baseline 55.8 and **+0.8 LAS / +2.5 comp:obl F over the sandhied-surface model** 53.5/42.0 —
  reverting the marked sandhi removes surface variation). UFAL was put **into training**, not held
  out. (`corpus_sa_sandhi/` + `training_sa_sandhi/` are the superseded sandhied-surface arm.)
- **comp/mod stays un-relabelled.** `scripts/ufal_compmod_probe.py` confirmed on classical UFAL
  that the LLM is at chance on the case-marked Ins/Acc/Gen residue (0.43 vs 0.82 majority), same as
  Vedic — structural (Sanskrit is case-based, not prepositional).
- **Bundles `clause_parser`** (`punct_tag="PUNCT"`; `DEFAULT_PUNCT` already covers the daṇḍa
  ।॥ `|` `||` / . ? !), like the former `sa_sud_vedic`, for raw multi-clause inference; packaged
  with `spacy package … --code scripts/sa_tokenizer.py,scripts/clause_parser.py`. The shipped
  pipeline is `[tok2vec, tagger, parser, clause_parser]`.
